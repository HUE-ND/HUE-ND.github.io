_Cities in Text: Rome_ provides access to selected travel guides allowing one to
trace the city’s urban and architectural development. These guides, housed in
the Library of the [American Academy in Rome][1], include Bernardo Gamucci’s
_Dell’Antichita della Citta di Roma_, published in 1565, Gio. Domenico Franzini’s
_Descrittione di Roma Antica e Moderna_, published in 1643 and Giuseppe Vasi’s
_Itinerario Istrutivo Diviso in Otto Giornate_, published in 1777. These specific
texts were chosen for the quality of their scholarship, observations,
illustrations, maps and itineraries. Each text has been digitized, translated,
illustrated, and geo-located. From the website one can program the related
mobile application to take historic documentation into the field. These curated
walking tours allow scholars and students alike to access library resources
while exploring the city.
